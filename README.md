# GLPI 10 Customization Plugin

## INFO

This repository is a fork
of [https://github.com/stdonato/glpi-modifications](https://github.com/stdonato/glpi-modifications). As the original
owner of this repository does not continue to support future versions of GLPI, we decided to maintain it.
It acts a little different and has fewer functionalities than the original plugin.

This plugin and it's maintainers are not connected to the GLPI project in any way.

## FEATURE LIST

- replace GLPI logo of login page and menu with custom logo
- add background to login page

## ON PLUGIN UNINSTALL (NOT DISABLING)

- background and custom logos are deleted
